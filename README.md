[**Non-unique Elements**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/nonUnique.py) - You are given a list of integers. For this task, you should return a list consisting of only the non-unique elements in this list. To do so you will need to remove all unique elements (elements which are contained in a given list only once). When solving this task, do not change the order of the list. Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3] 1 and 3 non-unique elements and result will be [1, 3, 1, 3].

[**Solve median**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/median.py) - A median is a numerical value separating the upper half of a list of numbers from the lower half. For this mission, you are given a list of integers. With it, you must separate the upper half of the numbers from the lower half and find the median.

[**Password**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/password.py) - The password will be considered strong enough if its length is greater than or equal to 10 symbols, it has at least one number, as well as containing one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter in it. Input data: A string that is a password (Unicode for python 2.7). Output data: The output will be true if the password is safe, a boolean or any data type that can be converted and processed as a boolean.

[**Transposed Matrix**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/transMatrix.py) - You have been given a matrix as a 2D list with integers. Your task is to return a transposed matrix based on input. Input: A matrix. A list of lists with integers. Output: A transposed matrix. A list of lists with integers. 

[**Weekend Counter**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/weekCount.py) - You should to count each day of rest (Saturday and Sunday) starting from the initial date to final date. Count the initial and final dates if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday.

[**Xs and Os Referee**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/xo.py) - Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D." Input: A game's result. A list of strings (Unicode). Output: "X", "O" or "D". A string. 

[**Fizz buzz**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/fizzBuzz.py) - You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return: "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5; "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3; "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;
