[**Non-unique Elements**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/nonUnique.py) - You are given a list of integers. For this task, you should return a list consisting of only the non-unique elements in this list. To do so you will need to remove all unique elements (elements which are contained in a given list only once). When solving this task, do not change the order of the list. Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3] 1 and 3 non-unique elements and result will be [1, 3, 1, 3].
