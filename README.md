[**Non-unique Elements**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/nonUnique.py) - You are given a list of integers. For this task, you should return a list consisting of only the non-unique elements in this list. To do so you will need to remove all unique elements (elements which are contained in a given list only once). When solving this task, do not change the order of the list. Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3] 1 and 3 non-unique elements and result will be [1, 3, 1, 3].

[**Solve median**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/median.py) - A median is a numerical value separating the upper half of a list of numbers from the lower half. For this mission, you are given a list of integers. With it, you must separate the upper half of the numbers from the lower half and find the median.

[**Password**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/password.py) - The password will be considered strong enough if its length is greater than or equal to 10 symbols, it has at least one number, as well as containing one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter in it. Input data: A string that is a password (Unicode for python 2.7). Output data: The output will be true if the password is safe, a boolean or any data type that can be converted and processed as a boolean.

[**Transposed Matrix**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/transMatrix.py) - You have been given a matrix as a 2D list with integers. Your task is to return a transposed matrix based on input. Input: A matrix. A list of lists with integers. Output: A transposed matrix. A list of lists with integers.
