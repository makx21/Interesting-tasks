[**Non-unique Elements**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/nonUnique.py) - You are given a list of integers. For this task, you should return a list consisting of only the non-unique elements in this list. To do so you will need to remove all unique elements (elements which are contained in a given list only once). When solving this task, do not change the order of the list. Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3] 1 and 3 non-unique elements and result will be [1, 3, 1, 3].

[**Solve median**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/median.py) - A median is a numerical value separating the upper half of a list of numbers from the lower half. For this mission, you are given a list of integers. With it, you must separate the upper half of the numbers from the lower half and find the median.

[**Password**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/password.py) - The password will be considered strong enough if its length is greater than or equal to 10 symbols, it has at least one number, as well as containing one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter in it. Input data: A string that is a password (Unicode for python 2.7). Output data: The output will be true if the password is safe, a boolean or any data type that can be converted and processed as a boolean.

[**Transposed Matrix**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/transMatrix.py) - You have been given a matrix as a 2D list with integers. Your task is to return a transposed matrix based on input. Input: A matrix. A list of lists with integers. Output: A transposed matrix. A list of lists with integers. 

[**Weekend Counter**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/weekCount.py) - You should to count each day of rest (Saturday and Sunday) starting from the initial date to final date. Count the initial and final dates if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday.

[**Xs and Os Referee**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/xo.py) - Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D." Input: A game's result. A list of strings (Unicode). Output: "X", "O" or "D". A string. 

[**Fizz buzz**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/fizzBuzz.py) - You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return: "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5; "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3; "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;

[**Three words**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/threeWords.py) - You are given a string with words and numbers separated by whitespaces (one space). The words contains only letters. You should check if the string contains three words in succession.

[**Feed Pigeons**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/feedPig.py) - I start to feed one of the pigeons. A minute later two more fly by and a minute after that another 3. Then 4, and so on (Ex: 1+2+3+4+...). One portion of food lasts a pigeon for a minute, but in case there's not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons who arrived first ate first. Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without knowing when to stop. If I have N portions of bird feed, how many pigeons will be fed with at least one portion of wheat?

[**Striped Words**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/stripedWords.py) - You are given a block of text with different words. These words are separated by white-spaces and punctuation marks. Numbers are not considered words in this mission (a mix of letters and digits is not a word either). You should count the number of words (striped words) where the vowels with consonants are alternating, that is; words that you count cannot have two consecutive vowels or consonants. The words consisting of a single letter are not striped -- do not count those.

[**Verify anagrams**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/anagrams.py) - An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. Two words are anagrams to each other if we can get one from another by rearranging the letters. Anagrams are case-insensitive and don't take account whitespaces. For example: "Gram Ring Mop" and "Programming" are anagrams. But "Hello" and "Ole Oh" are not.

[**Point In Polygon**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/pointInPolygon.php) - Determining Whether A Point Is Inside A Complex Polygon

[**2D Array in Spiral pattern**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/spiral.py) - Print a 2D nested list in clockwise direction, from the top left corner to the center.

[**Deepest pit in array**](https://github.com/makx21/interesting-tasks/blob/master/home/depth.php)
Given a zero-indexed array of integers A[N], we can define a "pit" (of this array)
a triplet of integers (P,Q,R) such that they follow these rules:
0 ≤ P < Q < R < N
A[P] > A[P+1] > ... > A[Q] (strictly decreasing) and
A[Q] < A[Q+1] < ... < A[R] (strictly increasing).
We can also define the depth of this pit as the number
min{A[P] − A[Q], A[R] − A[Q]}.
You should write a method (function) my_func(int[] A) which returns the depth of the deepest pit in array A or -1 if it does not exit. 
Costraints: N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [−100,000,000..100,000,000].
