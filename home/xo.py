# You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be
# the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins.
# If the game is a draw, return "D." 

# Input: A game's result. A list of strings (Unicode). 
# Output: "X", "O" or "D". A string.
